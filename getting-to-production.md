# Getting to production

## Setup your own organization and SoloID Service
Contact Signaturgruppen <support@signaturgruppen.dk> when you have tested the basic integration and are ready to move on to setting up your own SoloID Service and setup a commercial agreement with Signaturgruppen.

We will help you get started with your own setup and setup the access for administration that fits your organization.

## Required information
Your SoloID Service(s) consists of a name and a logo which identifies your service. The name and logo will be shown to the user in the SoloID Authenticator app when the user interacts with any SoloID flow or OTP sent from your integration.
The logo should be less than 200KB and preferable in **.png** (.svg support is in the works).
Signaturgruppen will manually verify the logo and name and will register your services. 

## Integration
You will receive an API client for the SoloID API integration and/or receive access to the administration UI which enables you to setup the API clients manually, choosing the secrets and secrets type used for the integration etc.
